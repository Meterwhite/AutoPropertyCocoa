     This is a necessary step to get runtimelock,which allows APC to actually delete a method at runtime.
     
     If you always operate on an instance object, you can ignore the method.
     
     If you operate on a Class type and will unbind it, calling this method will make the process safer.
     When you operate on a Class type without calling this method,a fake non-method(like apc_null_getter) is generated to undo the behavior of the deleted method when the hooked method is unbound.
     So if you want to swizzle a method for superclass, you should clearly use your target class instead of the class that was once unbundled.If you know this, then you can not call this method.It is no problem.
